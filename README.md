# 📨 Spamnett

**Spamnett** is an NLP-powered machine learning model that helps identify **spam emails and SMS messages** with high accuracy.  
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to detect suspicious or unwanted text messages automatically.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 Trained NLP model to classify messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**
- 🔍 Text preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- 📊 Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- 💾 Model persistence for easy reuse (via pickle or joblib)
- 🌐 Optional web interface (Flask/Streamlit) for live testing

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **NLTK / spaCy**
- **Flask** *(optional for web UI)*

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset (removes punctuation, converts to lowercase, removes stopwords, etc.)  
2. **Feature Extraction:** Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.  
3. **Model Training:** Trains a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM).  
4. **Prediction:** Classifies new messages as `Spam` or `Not Spam`.
